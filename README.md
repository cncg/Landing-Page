## Overview

### The challenge

The goal is to get everything as close as possible to the solution images. Create a header, four sections of the body and finally a footer. The project as well as styling ideas was provided by The Odin Project.

## Our process

Starting with good file structure, and analyzing the desired end result. Look at the desired result and visualize where you will utilize FlexBox. Work from the top down. Refer to reference every 3 minutes pretty much. Work was done in a browser IDE, such as CodePen. Once the code looks good and comes up with no bugs in testing, it is moved over to the repo, test again and then push! Repeat until satisfied, then tweak 300 more things & then you're done! Overall, very good practice and great project to work and collaborate on. The layout is very versatile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS3
- FlexBox

### Useful resources

- [Flex Exercises from Odin's Repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/tree/main/flex) - This helped me recap on some basic FlexBox layouts and how to make them work and not be magic. Always a useful place to go when stuck! (look for the solutions folder!)
